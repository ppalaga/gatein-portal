        /*
        At the time of the implementation, there were two options here for
        retrieving applications from the permanent storage:

        1) use the existing service and expose only the methods we want as part of the public API;
        2) use the existing service only as a reference, making a completely independent call to the storage,
        parsing the results by ourselves.

        The chosen approach is, at least for now, the approach 1.

        The advantage of the approach 1 is that this place here is "clean", in the sense that we reuse everything that
        is being done already, and don't need to implement possible changes in two places, possibly having differences
        in the implementation, causing inconsistent behavior.

        The disadvantage is that the current logic is not a perfect fit for our needs, and might get more data retrieved
        than we need. For instance, applications are grouped into categories, and then iterated over to return a list of
        applications. The concept of categories is absent from the public API, so, it's not used here.
        Also, there's already a place to convert raw data into an Application object, a logic that is
        useless to us, as we'll convert it again into a representation that we want to expose as part of the API.

        As mentioned, the "reuse" argument seems the strongest right now, and we might revisit this decision in the
        future, should it present severe performance problems.
